Bitcoin button plugin
=====================

This Wordpress plugin providing a shortcode for showing links to bitcoin addresses
which can for example be used as a donation address.

Example shortcode:
[bitcoin address="1GRJ6119tmKDUfr8HWR4VaYrvJ6oKns9jp"]

The shortcode will insert a small button that links to the Bitcoin address. When
the mouse is hovered over the button a QR code representing the address is shown.
Further info on the address can be shown to the right of the button. This info is
fetched from the API at http://blockchain.info/.

To show the number of transactions the address has been used in:
[bitcoin address="1GRJ6119tmKDUfr8HWR4VaYrvJ6oKns9jp" info="transaction"]

To show the amount received by the address:
[bitcoin address="1GRJ6119tmKDUfr8HWR4VaYrvJ6oKns9jp" info="received"]

To show the current balance of the address:
[bitcoin address="1GRJ6119tmKDUfr8HWR4VaYrvJ6oKns9jp" info="balance"]

To show no info other than the address and QR code:
[bitcoin address="1GRJ6119tmKDUfr8HWR4VaYrvJ6oKns9jp" info="none"]

Widgets

It is also possible to use shortcodes in widgets but this requires an additional
plugin to be installed (e.g http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shortcodes-in-sidebar-widgets/).
